The Smart Vehicle Service & Maintenance CRM is a Salesforce-based CRM solution designed to optimize vehicle servicing operations. It connects Customers, Technicians, and Service Managers into one system to streamline service request handling, workload management, parts tracking, invoicing, and customer communication.

This project demonstrates the use of Custom Objects, Page Layouts, Profiles, Sharing Rules, Lightning Web Components (LWC), and Automation in Salesforce.
Use Cases
1. Service Request Management:
->Customer books a service request (via form/portal).
->System auto-assigns a technician based on skills & workload.
->Customer receives confirmation via email/SMS.

2. Vehicle History Tracking:
->Every service request is linked to the customer’s vehicle.
->System auto-updates Last Service Date.
->Service history visible to technicians & managers.

3. Technician & Workload Management:
->Service Manager assigns/auto-assigns jobs.
->Technicians view assigned tasks on their LWC dashboard.
->Status updates: In Progress → Completed.

4. Parts & Inventory Management:
->Parts used during service are logged automatically.
->Inventory stock auto-reduces.
->Low stock alerts triggered if threshold is reached.

5. Preventive Maintenance Reminders:
->Monthly batch job sends preventive service reminders.
->Notifications via email/SMS.

6. Invoice & Payment Handling:
->Auto-generated invoice on service completion.
->Invoices > ₹10,000 require approval.
->Online payment supported via payment gateway integration.

7. Customer Communication:
->SMS/Email notifications at each stage: Booked, In Progress, Completed.
->Customers can track service status on portal (LWC).

8. Reporting & Dashboards:
->Service requests by type (regular, emergency, annual checkup).
->Technician productivity & workload distribution.
->Monthly revenue per service center.
->Inventory usage & trends.

  Update Records: Assign Technician__c from Get Records to Service Request
  Email Alert: Notify customer of technician assignment
  Flow Activation: Saved and activated

9.Approval Process (Invoices > ₹10,000)
