2. Stakeholder Analysis
Primary Stakeholders:

    - Technicians ? Execute services, update jobs, track parts used.
    - Service Managers ? Allocate work, monitor operations, approve invoices.

    - Salesforce Admins/Developers ? Configure & maintain CRM.

3. Business Process Mapping (Current vs. Proposed)
Current (Manual & Inefficient):
    - Service requests captured manually or via phone.
    - Technician allocation done on paper/Excel.
    - Inventory tracked in spreadsheets.
    - Customers lack visibility into progress.
    - No preventive reminders, leading to lost business.
Proposed (Salesforce CRM-enabled):
    - Service requests booked via portal or call center ? auto-captured in CRM.
    - Automated technician assignment based on skills/workload.
    - Parts usage auto-updates inventory; reorder alerts triggered.
    - Customers notified via SMS/email at each stage.
    - Preventive maintenance reminders sent automatically.
    - Dashboards give managers visibility into revenue, workload, and KPIs.
